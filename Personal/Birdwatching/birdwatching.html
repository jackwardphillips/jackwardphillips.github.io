            <div class="caption">The fence became a common spot for birds to perch, like this Carolina wren.
                It stood there for some time, singing its distinct song.

            <img src="images/carolina chickadee.jpg" onclick="openModal(this)">
            <div class="caption">Another Carolina chickadee. They're not very big, so they often don't eat
                on the birdfeeder, being scared away by larger birds.

            <img src="images/northern mockingbird.jpg" onclick="openModal(this)">
            <div class="caption">This is a northern mockingbird, perched atop the fence. I saw this pretty early on, but haven't seen
                many since.

            <img src="images/northern cardinal.jpg" onclick="openModal(this)">
            <div class="caption">The northern cardinals are pretty funny around the birdfeeder. I've only seen one perch on it once,
                they much prefer to scavange for the bits of birdseed that have fallen on the floor below it.

            <div class="caption">I've seen no bird more than the tufted titmouse, a favorite of my great-grandfather. This is a photo
                from a new window feeder I bought. I've loved getting a closer look at them through it.
